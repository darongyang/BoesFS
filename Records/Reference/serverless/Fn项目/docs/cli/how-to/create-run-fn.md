# Create and Run Functions with Fn
This how-to covers how to create and test functions.

## Create a Boilerplate Function with Init
Fn provides the `init` option to setup or create a function you can test. To created a "Hello World" function using boilerplate code type: 

    fn init --runtime node nodefn

The command generates four files: 

* `func.js` - A boilerplate Node.js JavaScript function.
* `func.yaml` - A boilerplate YAML file containing boilerplate configuration options for the function.
* `package.json` - A list of packages required for the function.
* `test.json` - A file for running tests on your function.

The key Fn configuration file here is the `func.yaml` file. The file created from the sample command would be: 

```yaml
name: nodefn
version: 0.0.1
runtime: node
entrypoint: node func.js
```

For more information on possible value in the `func.yaml` file see **Link to funcfile doc**.

## Set the Version Number when Creating a Function
By default, when the `func.yaml` file is created, the version is set to `0.0.1`. If you with to start with a different number use the version command.

    fn init --version 1.0.1  --runtime node t1

This creates a `func.yaml` file with a version set to `1.01`.

```yaml
name: t1
version: 1.0.1
runtime: node
entrypoint: node func.js
```

## Create a `func.yaml` using an Existing Function File
You can create a `func.yaml` file from an existing function file. For example, if I have a function named `func.js` in a directory named `t3`. Run the init command:

    fn init

Fn will find your function file, determine it is a type Node and generate a func.yaml for you. For example

```yaml
name: t3
version: 0.0.1
runtime: node
entrypoint: node func.js
```

## Configure image signature details in `func.yaml`
You can sign function images using Oracle OCI keys. This is supported only when Oracle Provider is used. For more details on signing images refer to [OCIR Image Signature.](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Registry/Tasks/registrysigningimages_topic.htm)

To sign the function image, add the following section to `func.yaml` before running the `fn deploy` command. The `fn deploy` command will push the function image to the [OCI Container Registry (OCIR)](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Registry/home.htm) and use the signing details provided to sign the function image in OCIR.
```yaml
signing_details:
  image_compartment_id: ocid1.tenancy.oc1..aaaaaaaaba3____dsq
  kms_key_id: ocid1.key.oc1.phx.bbqehaq3aadfa.abyh______qlj
  kms_key_version_id: ocid1.keyversion.oc1.phx.0.bbqehaq3aadfa.acy6______mbb
  signing_algorithm: SHA_224_RSA_PKCS_PSS
```
where:
- `image_compartment_id`: [OCID of the tenant to which image repository belongs](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm#tenancy_ocid)
- `kms_key_id`: OCID of the master encryption key to use to sign the image
- `kms_key_version_id`: OCID of the key version to use to sign the image
- `signing_algorithm`: [Signing Algorithm to use to sign the image](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/key/release/datatypes/SignDataDetails)
