# Use DEBUG=1 for Client Commands

If you're interacting with functions via the `fn` CLI, you can enable debug
mode to see the full details of the HTTP requests going to the Fn server and
the responses. The `fn` CLI simply wraps the Fn API to make it easier to
manage your applications and functions. You can always use `curl` but the CLI 
is much more convenient!

You enable debug mode by adding `DEBUG=1` before `fn` on each command.  For
example try the following:

![user input](images/userinput.png)
>```sh
> DEBUG=1 fn ls apps
>```

Which, with debugging turn on, returns the following:

```sh
GET /v2/apps HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8080
User-Agent: Go-http-client/1.1
Accept: application/json
Accept-Encoding: gzip


HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Length: 977
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

All debug output is written to stderr while the normal response is written
to stdout so it's easy to capture or pipe either for processing.
