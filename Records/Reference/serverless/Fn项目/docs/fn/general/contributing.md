# Contributing Documentation

When creating a Pull Request, make sure that you also update the documentation
accordingly.

Most of the time, when making some behavior more explicit or adding a feature,
documentation update is necessary.

You will either update a file inside docs/ or create one. Prefer the former over
the latter. If you are unsure, do not hesitate to open a PR with a comment
asking for suggestions on how to address the documentation part.
